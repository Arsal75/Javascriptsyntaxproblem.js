Description:

This JavaScript code snippet demonstrates a common syntax error that developers might encounter. The missing closing parenthesis ")" at the end of the console.log statement results in a syntax error when the code is executed.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!";
```

Here are some more examples of syntax errors in JavaScript:

1. Missing semicolon at the end of a statement:

```javascript
var x = 5
```

2. Undefined variable:

```javascript
console.log(y);
```

3. Missing closing curly brace:

```javascript
if (true) {
    console.log("Hello");
```

4. Misspelled function name:

```javascript
consol.log("Hello");
```

These examples serve as reminders to carefully check syntax to ensure smooth execution of JavaScript programs.
